# Getting Started

?> In order to start using `restio` you must have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed on your machine.

## Installation

The first thing we need to do is add the `restio` package to our `pubspec.yaml` as a dependency.

```yaml
dependencies:
  restio: ^0.6.0
```

## Import

Now that we have successfully installed `restio`, we can create our `main.dart` and import `restio`.

```dart
import 'package:restio/restio.dart';
```
